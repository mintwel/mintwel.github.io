# Covid Cases and Rates in the US in 2020
This project is focused on tracking the counts and rates of Covid-19 cases in the United States in 2020.
As such, the project is called "Covid Cases in the US in 2020."
This project is important as it tracks a very relevant and important topic that affects our daily lives. The ability to visualize Covid-19 cases and rates can help us understand which communities were hit the hardest in 2020, as well as provides a reference during unprecedented times.

### Sources and Libraries
The sources for the data in this lab largely came from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv). This data includes all 2020 cases of Covid-19. When calculating the Covid-19 rates, the population data came from the [2018 ACS 5 year estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US.050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true). All of the data is by county, and the US county shapefile came from the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).

This lab also makes use of the [Mapbox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/), which provides the basemaps.
