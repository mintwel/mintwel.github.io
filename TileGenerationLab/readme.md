# Map Design and Tile Generation (Lab 4)
GEOG 458
By: Minttu Welander

## Project Overview
This project showcases four maps with generated tiles on a Mapbox baselayer. All four maps follow an environmental theme. The interactive map can be found [here](https://mintwel.github.io/TileGenerationLab/index.html).

## Map Layers
### Tile Set 1 with Modified Basemap
Map Descritption: This map showcases the basemap using Mapbox's monochrome basemap. It is focused on the Seattle area and showcases the geographic features of the area.
