# Map Design and Tile Generation (Lab 4)
GEOG 458
By: Minttu Welander

## Project Overview
This project showcases four maps with generated tiles on a Mapbox baselayer. The interactive map can be found [here](https://mintwel.github.io/TileGenerationLab/index.html).

## Map Layers
### Tile Set 1 with Modified Basemap
This map showcases the basemap using Mapbox's monochrome basemap. It is focused on the Seattle area and showcases the geographic features of the area.

Basemap: Monochrome Bubblegum from Mapbox
Zoom Level: Min - 8, Max - 10
Geography: Seattle, WA

### Thematic Tile Set 2 with Basemap
This map showcases the park areas in Seattle. I personally love spending time in parks and wanted to show all of the park locations in the Seattle area. Here it also becomes apparent how many parks Seattle really has!
